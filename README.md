# 🧠 My LeetCode Journey

This repository is a personal collection of my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
It’s part of my continuous effort to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## 📌 Goals

- Practice consistently
- Write clean and efficient code
- Document solution patterns and key takeaways
- Track progress over time

## 💻 Language(s) Used

- [x] Golang (primary)
- [ ] Python / C++ / Java (maybe in the future)

## 📂 Structure

Each problem is placed under a folder with its number and name:

```
leetcode/
├── 0001-two-sum/
│ ├── main.go
│ └── README.md
├── 0020-valid-parentheses/
│ ├── main.go
│ └── README.md
...
```


Each subfolder typically contains:
- ✅ Code solution
- 📄 A brief explanation (`README.md`)
- 🕒 Time/space complexity analysis (if notable)

## 🗂️ Problem Progress

| #  | Title                     | Status  | Language |
|----|---------------------------|---------|----------|
| 1  | Two Sum                   | ✅ Done | Go       |
| 20 | Valid Parentheses         | ✅ Done | Go       |
| 53 | Maximum Subarray          | 🚧 WIP  | Go       |
| ...| ...                       | ⏳ Todo | Go       |

## 📖 Notes & Patterns

I document any common patterns I find, like:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Binary Search
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming

(See [`/notes`](./notes/) directory if available)

## 🔖 Tags (Planned)

I'm considering tagging problems by topic:
- `array`
- `hashmap`
- `stack`
- `recursion`
- `greedy`
- `dp`

## 🧭 Why I’m Doing This

As an intermediate Go developer, I want to:
- Stay sharp with data structures and algorithms
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews
- Reflect on and learn from each problem I solve
